This repository contains the necessary files needed to build and run a 2D space shooter game created by me. Game development is a hobby of mine and this game will be the first of a series I plan to create to hone both  my c# skills and my project development skills. I am still learning but I hope you enjoy the game. If any bugs are found please let me know.
